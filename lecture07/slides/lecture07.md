### Concurrency

## Agenda
- Practice 1 - do Hacker News user like "X"?
- Practice 2 - Fixing Billing Service

## ExecutorService
```java
ExecutorService es = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
Future<?> futureResult = es.submit(() -> System.out.println("Hello from another thread"));
try {
    futureResult.get();
} catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
Execute async task in configurable thread pool

---
## ConcurrentHashMap
```java
Map<String, Stats> stats = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
```
Thread-safe map with full concurrency of retrievals and high expected concurrency for updates

---
## Volatile
```java
private volatile int latestPostId = 0;
```
- Write to volatile variable is always seen from subsequent read
- volatile

---
## AtomicInteger
```java
lastProcessedId.incrementAndGet()
```


---
## ArrayBlockingQueue
```java
private ArrayBlockingQueue<String> contentQueue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(5);

contentQueue.put(s);//block here the queue if is full
contentQueue.take();//block here if queue is empty
```
Queue that blocks caller thread if goes out of bounds. Useful for synchronizing stages in pipeline;

## What if we just write concurrent program as single-threaded?
**Many things will go wrong**

## Billing example
This simple example shows how you can loose money when using bad synchronization Oo  
Billing service allow to transfer money between users  
```bash
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/billing/addUser -d "user=sasha&money=100000"
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/billing/addUser -d "user=sergey&money=100000"
curl localhost:8080/billing/stat
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/billing/sendMoney -d "from=sergey&to=sasha&money=1"
```
Start server and emulate fast money transfer with **jmeter**. Then look at stat again:
```bash
curl localhost:8080/billing/stat
```
> @see billing

---
## You've lost your money (or gained)
Technically, the invariant was broken:
> Total amount of money in system must be preserved during **sendMoney**

Why we loose money?  
Because in multithreaded systems **guarantees are weaker** than in single-threaded.  
Multithreaded systems **without proper synchronization** have some problems.

---
## Race condition
Race condition (состояние гони, гонка)
program behaviour where the output is dependent on the
sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events  
  
Behaviour of multithreaded program is (inter alia) dependent on **OS scheduling**  
  
**Uncontrollable races are almost always erroneous**  

---
## Data races
**Data race** - when several processes communicate via **shared mutable state** and at least one is writing **without proper synchronization**  
 (Not the same as race conditions)

---
## TIL
- volatile
- ConcurrentHashMap
- BlockingQueue
- Atomic
- If you write concurrent programs like single-threaded you can get into trouble
